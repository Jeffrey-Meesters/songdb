##Codaisseur week 3

**Homework assignment**
During this week we learned, amongst other things, to use Jbuilder and AJAX in RoR.
This app is the homework assignment to show that you understand how it works.

- I used AJAX to submit new songs.
- I used Jbuilder to delete songs.

**What doesn't work?**
New songs get rendered, but without delete button.
After refresh the delete button is shown.
Refreshing is not wanted.
